# IWG_hatespeech_public
public repository of the interdisciplinary working group 'hate speech detection' of the research training group [User-Centred Social Media](http://www.ucsm.info)


This repository contains a German, annotated corpus of tweets regarding refugees in Germany.
The tweets are annotated with hate speech ratings.
We dissociate ourselves from all contained opinions.


Details of the scheme and purpose are described in:

- Björn Ross, Michael Rist, Guillermo Carbonell, Benjamin Cabrera, Nils Kurowsky, and Michael Wojatzki, [Measuring the Reliability of Hate Speech Annotations: The Case of the European Refugee Crisis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.08118.pdf), Proceedings of NLP4CMC III: 3rd Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Computer-Mediated Communication (Bochum) (Michael Beißwenger, Michael Wojatzki, and Torsten Zesch, eds.), Bochumer Linguistische Arbeitsberichte, vol. 17, sep 2016, pp. 6-9.
