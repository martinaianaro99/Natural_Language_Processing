The HaSpeeDe2 dataset is split into a development and a test set, plus the labeled version of the test set (files named as "reference"). 
The task was divided into three subtasks: 
Task A - Hate Speech Detection (Main Task): binary classification task aimed at determining the presence or the absence of hateful content in the text towards a given target (among immigrants, Muslims and Roma)
Task B - Stereotype Detection (Pilot Task 1): binary classification task aimed at determining the presence or the absence of a stereotype towards the same targets as Task A
Task C - Identification of Nominal Utterances (Pilot Task 2): sequence labeling task aimed at recognizing NUs in data previously labeled as hateful.

Each file is duplicated and annotated with different information: - taskAB files contain annotations for hate speech and stereotypes; - taskC files contain annotations regarding the presence of Nominal Utterances
